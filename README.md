# thefeed
The goal of this app is to eliminate food waste and help hungry college students. When a club or group has extra food from a meeting or party,
they can post to the Feed. They can post the locatin, type of food, and how much is left. Anyone nearby who is hungry will see a notification and can go grab some grub.

This app is not complete, but the idea is very intruiging and I hope to finish it in the future.
